# PGP: The Portfolio Generatio Program

The aim of this project is the development of an investment platform for personal use. The software is geared towards the construction of optimized financial portfolios from a pre-determined asset universe. The user is given the freedom to choose among a variety of standard, well-established, investment strategies, and, together with its personal risk-return preferences, the program will generate an optimal asset allocation. The overall infrastructure is user-friendly with a dedicated graphical interface that facilitates investment analytics and decisions. 

# User Guide
To effectively assist our users in navigating the project, we have prepared this user manual, which outlines the necessary steps for utilizing the PGP platform.

### PGP Preparations
If you are new to the PGP or have not used it for an extended period, please ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment. Take a moment to consult the pip/Conda documentation to learn how to install any missing dependencies.

### PGP Launch
After successfully installing the dependencies, you can now launch the PGP. Navigate to the main folder where you downloaded the .py files and execute the **main.py** file using the terminal command
```console
python main.py
```
If you are using the program for the first time or wish to update your return and information .csv files to ensure the latest data, please choose the "YES" option when prompted by the program. It is recommended to update the data whenever in doubt, as having the most recent information justifies the brief waiting period.
